# 🚀 Production Deployment Pipeline
# Advanced deployment workflow with blue-green deployment strategy
#
# 📋 Setup Instructions:
# 1. Slack Notifications: Uncomment Slack notification steps and configure SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL secret
# 2. Environments: Set up production and staging environments in GitHub repository settings
# 3. Secrets: Configure GITHUB_TOKEN (usually auto-provided) and any custom secrets
